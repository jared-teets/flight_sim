# COPILOT EDITS OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

## PRIME DIRECTIVE
    Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
    Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
    Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE
    When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
        1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
            2. Your plan MUST include:
                   - All functions/sections that need modification
                   - The order in which changes should be applied
                   - Dependencies between changes
                   - Estimated number of separate edits required

            3. Format your plan as:
## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
    Working with: [filename]
    Total planned edits: [number]


## Folder Structure
